Notes:
  This program was totally re-designed and re-written for
  ODSToolbox Version 2.0. It is not based on Version 1.0.

  While this new version of read_odf corrects many errors in
  Version 1.0, and includes some new functionalities such as
  checking if all mandatory header blocks and all mandatory
  fields are presented in the input ODF file etc., it is possible
  that this program may have some conflicts with other tools in
  ODSToolbox, please email yongcun.hu@dfo-mpo.gc.ca if the
  user find any problems.
